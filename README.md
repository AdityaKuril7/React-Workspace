# React Workspace

This repository is a backup of my React learning journey and projects.  
It contains two main folders:

---

## 1. Learning React With Project
This folder contains all the files related to learning React.  
Here, I am learning React by building small projects and practicing different concepts.  

> Example apps: `useState-counter`, `props-example`, `conditional-rendering`, etc.

---

## 2. Perfect Project
This folder contains my complete and polished React projects.  
These are production-ready projects that I have fully developed and can be used in my portfolio.  

> Example apps: `ExpenseTracker`, `NotesApp`, `WeatherApp`, etc.

## Note
- This repository is currently **private** and is used only for backup purposes.  
- In the future, I may make specific projects **public** to showcase them in my portfolio.
